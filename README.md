# GET OFF MY LAWN

This is the Safari version of [miketaylr's Get Off My Lawn](https://addons.opera.com/addons/extensions/details/get-off-my-lawn) extension for Opera.

Verbatim from his extension:

> Social Media widgets bringing you down? BLOCK THE CRUFT.
> 
> By default, this extension will block: Google "plus one", and "buzz" buttons, Facebook "like" and "connect" buttons, "tweet this" buttons, share on Linked In button, Stumbleupon buttons, and the "Add This" button.
> 
> Currently the extension will block these widgets only if they are usually their official API endpoints.
> 
> Users can toggle any of these on or off in the preferences page. For example, this extension probably breaks facebook.com. But if you're installing it, there's a good chance that's a feature. If that bums you out, you can turn off Facebook blocking.
